    <p>When I was five I loved eating so much toast. It was my favorite. I would eat it all day every day.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Peanut Butter</li>
        <li>Bread</li>
        <li>Topping (I prefer honey or jelly)</li>
        <li>Milk (not required but definitely helps wash it down)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put bread in toaster until it pops up.</li>
        <li>Spread as much peanut butter as you want on the bread with a knife.</li>
        <li>Top it off with some delicious topping.</li>
        <li>I like to dip the toast in milk but other people think that's wierd so if that's not for you don't do it.</li>
    </ol>
